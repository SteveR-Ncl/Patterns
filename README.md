# Patterns
Examples of design patterns in Java
Adapting various examples from GoF book and on stackoverflow etc.
Includes:
Adapter: media-player based example
Visitor: traversing a composite consisting of bricks assembled into units. Also works as illustration of composite.
Factory: work in progress, over-complicated adaptation of GoF example and http://www.buyya.com/254/Patterns/Factory-2pp.pdf. Uses visitor to traverse the maze that's set up using factory. Needs documenting. And finishing.
